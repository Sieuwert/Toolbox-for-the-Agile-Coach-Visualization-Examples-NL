Heb je het idee dat de meeste onderbrekingen dezelfde oorzaak hebben? Wordt jouw frustratrie over iets of iemand steeds groter? 

Interruption buckets

Do you suspect that most of your interruptions have a common origin and source? Do you have a growing frustration towards someone or something? To turn that frustration into a data driven insight and data driven decision to change something, collect your interruptions on Post-its and sort them according to category. 

Do this for a couple of weeks and then bring the notes to a workshop where you analyze and discuss how you can reduce the frequency or pain of the interruptions. Or, instead of having a time-limit, whenever there are 5 or more notes in a bucket â€“ call for an interruption reduction workshop.
