Box on the floor

Are you standing so far from the wall that you can’t read the Post-its? Do people have to walk across the room to move a Post-it? Does it look like people are afraid of the wall?

Try Drawing a box on the floor (using white adhesive tape) in front of the team's board. 

I’ve found that for some strange reason, people like to stand inside boxes. Don’t be surprised if this simple trick makes people stand closer to the board. At least, you don’t have anything to lose by trying it once. 

Adhesive tape doesn’t stick that well to the floor, but I would not recommend painting or drawing directly on the floor.
