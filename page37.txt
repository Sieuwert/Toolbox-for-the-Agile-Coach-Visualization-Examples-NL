Parking lot with states

When you pause a full story and move the associated tickets to a Parking Lot it might be a good idea to preserve the states of the tasks.

This takes more space, but that could be used as a WIP-limit, i.e. no more than one story may be paused at any single point in time. 

Donâ€™t forget to write down the date when the story became paused.

This approach can be useful when something urgent arrives mid-sprint temporarily overriding the priorities.
