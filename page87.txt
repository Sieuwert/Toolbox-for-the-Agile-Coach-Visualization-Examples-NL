Servant Managers Door

I’ve heard many stories about how managers work with trust and transparency by visualizing which organizational impediments they are currently working on. This visualization is sometimes called “Management Door” or “Servant Leadership Board”.

Even though an autonomous team owns their own process and self-organizes their work, they often find a limit to their area of influence, which requires the support of managers to resolve impediments. Being transparent about which impediments you as a manager are currently addressing, and being honest about which one you’re currently not focusing on, is a simple and powerful way to build trust.
